        <p class="modal__about-text">Four of the West’s most infamous outlaws assemble to steal a huge stash of gold
            from the most corrupt settlement of the gold rush towns. But not all goes to plan one is killed and the
            other three escapes with bags of gold hide out in the abandoned gold mine where they happen across another
            gang of three – who themselves were planning to hit the very same bank! As tensions rise, things go from bad
            to worse as they realise the bags of gold are filled with lead... they’ve been double crossed – but by who
            and how?</p>
